# dubhub, a womxn's safety website

A website that provides womxn with UCI resources such as locations for free menstrual products, abuse assistance, safety escorts, hotlines, emergency blue poles etc.

Check out this [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Crny7plB_FdG3uAy7p4SYTa9jnwQ6keE/view?usp=sharing) to see how the frontend currently looks and works.

**NOTE:** This is a copy of [this organizational repository](https://github.com/ctc-uci/bp-women-safety). As one of the original repository's collaborators, I use this one for personal testing use.
